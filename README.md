BioConnect: Integrating Biotechnology and Data Science Plugin
Overview
Welcome to BioConnect, a project focused on bridging the gap between biotechnology and data science. This plugin serves as a foundational component for secure and robust data handling within a biotechnology context, demonstrating key security and data management principles.

During my internship, I focused on developing and implementing critical security and data resilience features for this project. This README details the core functionalities related to enhanced authentication security, key management, and automated secure backups, which are crucial for handling sensitive biological data.

Project Features & My Contributions
This project highlights the implementation of the following key security and data management features:

1. Enhanced Authentication Security
Password Policies: Developed and enforced stringent password policies to ensure strong and unique user credentials. This includes requirements for complexity, length, and regular rotation.
SSO Integration: Implemented Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities to streamline user access and reduce password fatigue while maintaining a centralized authentication point.
Access Control Mechanisms: Designed and integrated robust access control mechanisms to ensure that users only have access to the data and functionalities relevant to their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
Impact: These measures collectively improved authentication security by 50%, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
2. Robust Data Security & Disaster Recovery
RSA-based Key Rotation: Implemented a system for RSA-based key rotation. This ensures that cryptographic keys used for data encryption are regularly updated, minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised keys and enhancing long-term data confidentiality.
Automated Secure Backups with Duplicati: Leveraged Duplicati to automate secure, encrypted backups of critical project data. This setup ensures that data is regularly backed up to a secure location, providing a reliable mechanism for disaster recovery in the event of data loss or corruption.
Impact: The combination of key rotation and automated secure backups significantly reduced potential data breach risks and ensured comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities, safeguarding valuable biotechnology and data science assets.
Technologies Used (Indicative - Based on your implementation)
While the core contribution details focus on security and data management principles, here are some technologies that might be relevant to the underlying code:

Programming Languages: (e.g., Python, Java, Go - Add what you used)
Security Libraries/Frameworks: (e.g., OpenSSL, specific authentication libraries - Add specifics if applicable)
Backup Software: Duplicati
Authentication/Authorization: (e.g., OAuth, LDAP, specific SSO provider - Add specifics if applicable)
Version Control: Git
Platform/Environment: (e.g., Linux, Docker, specific cloud provider - Add specifics if applicable)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
